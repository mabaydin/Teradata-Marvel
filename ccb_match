This code selects all rows from the "table_name" table where the value of the "column_name" column starts with "ar" followed by one or more digits.
The REGEXP_SIMILAR function is used to match the regular expression pattern, where ^ matches the start of the string, ar matches the value "ar", 
[0-9]+ matches one or more digits, and $ matches the end of the string. The REGEXP_SIMILAR function returns 1 if the pattern matches and 0 if it does not, 
so the query returns all rows where the value of the "column_name" column starts with "ar" followed by one or more digits.


SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE REGEXP_SIMILAR(column_name, '^ar[0-9]+$') = 1;
